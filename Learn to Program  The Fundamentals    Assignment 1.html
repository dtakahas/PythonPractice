        <p>
            This handout assumes that you have watched all the week 2 videos and also done the week 2 exercise. If you read this handout before you've done all of that, please come back and re-read it after you've passed the week 2 exercise.

            Problem Domains
        </h3>
        <p>
            A <em>problem domain</em> is an area of expertise that needs to be understood in order to solve a problem. When programmers are hired, they usually need to learn about their customer's problem domain. For example, if a programmer is hired by a non-profit organization to help with their financial database, that programmer might have to learn how taxes apply to non-profit organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every assignment in this course will have a problem domain that you will need to learn about.
        </p>
        <h3>
            A1 Problem Domain: Coordinated Universal Time
        </h3>
        <p>
            The problem domain for this assignment involves time zones, and in particular <a target="_top" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"><em>Coordinated Universal Time</em></a> (UTC), which is "the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time" [Wikipedia]. As you know, there are many different time zones in the world. Wikipedia has a nice <a target="_top" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Standart_Time_Zones_2012.png/1280px-Standart_Time_Zones_2012.png">map of the time zones</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of this writing, there are 40 time zones. One of them, 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zones_by_UTC_offset#UTC.C2.B100:00.2C_Z">UTC+00:00</a>, is considered to be in the "middle" of the other time zones. All time zones have names, such as UTC+02:00, that indicate the number of hours and minutes they are away from UTC+00:00. For example, the Philippines are in time zone UTC+08:00 because clocks there are set 8 hours later than in time zone UTC+00:00.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Hours and minutes: representation
        </h3>
        <p>
            In this assignment, we are often going to represent hours and minutes and seconds together as a <code>float</code>. 1 hour will be represented as <code>1.0</code>, 1 hour and 30 minutes as <code>1.5</code>, and so on. Henceforth, when we specify a time zone, we will use this <code>float</code> representation, so the time zone for Nepal, which is in time zone UTC+05:45, will be represented here as UTC+5.75.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Preconditions
        </h3>
        <p>
            Some of the functions you will write assume that parameter values are in a certain range. The technical term for these restrictions is <em>precondition</em>: in order for the function to work, the precondition must be met. When you see a precondition, that means we are guaranteeing that we will only call that function with values that meet the precondition.

            Step 5: Write functions <code>get_hours</code>, <code>get_minutes</code> and <code>get_seconds</code>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Read this section and make sure you understand all of it before you proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have not provided starter code for these three functions, although we have described them fully in the table below. <em>Follow the Function Design Recipe</em> as you develop these functions in a1.py.
        </p>
        <p>
            The three functions, <code>get_hours</code>, <code>get_minutes</code> and <code>get_seconds</code>, are related: they are used to determine the hours part, minutes part and seconds part of a time in seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if <code>3800</code> seconds have elapsed since midnight:
        </p>
        <pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; get_hours(3800)
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; get_minutes(3800)
    3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; get_seconds(3800)
    20
            
</pre>
        <p>
            In other words, if <code>3800</code> seconds have elapsed since midnight, it is currently <code>01:03:20</code> (hh:mm:ss).
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is an overview of how we determined what the example function calls should return:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 60 seconds in 1 minute and 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 60, or 3600, seconds in 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Because there are 3600 seconds in an hour, there is 1 full hour in 3800 seconds. There are 200 seconds remaining.
            </li>
            <li>Because there are 60 seconds in a minute, there are 3 full minutes in 200 seconds. There are 20 seconds remaining.
            </li>
            <li>Therefore 3800 seconds is equivalent to 1 hour, 3 minutes and 20 seconds.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are several ways to write these three function bodies. You may find operators <code>%</code> and <code>//</code> to be helpful. Function <code>to_24_hour_clock</code> in the starter code has an example of using <code>%</code>.
